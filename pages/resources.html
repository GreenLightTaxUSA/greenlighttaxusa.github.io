        <h3>Identity Theft Afadavit</h3>

        <p>An Identity Theft Affidavit is a legal document that an individual fills out to report
          that they have been a victim of identity theft.</p>

        <p>This form serves as a formal statement detailing the circumstances under which the theft
          occurred and the specific fraudulent activities that have taken place using the victim's
          identity.</p>

        <h3>Federal Taxes</h3>

        <p>When a taxpayer believes their personal information is being used to file fraudulent tax
          returns, they should consider filing a Form 14039 online or by completing the paper Form
          14039, Identity Theft Affidavit PDF, which can then be printed and mailed or faxed to the
          IRS. In most cases, taxpayers do not need to complete this form.</p>

        <p>Only victims of tax-related identity theft should submit the Form 14039, and only if they
          haven't received certain letters from the IRS.</p>

        <p>All taxpayers can request an Identity Protection Personal Identification Number (IP PIN)
          using the Get An Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN) tool on IRS.gov to protect themselves
          from becoming a victim of tax-related identity theft.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>State Taxes</h3>

        <p>Each state has its own way of handling tax-related identity theft.</p>

        <p>You'll want to check your state’s tax authority website for specific instructions or forms
          to report the issue.</p>

        <p>What to Do: Look for an identity theft form or affidavit specific to your state.</p>

        <p>It’ll ask for similar information as the IRS form—like details about what happened and any
          suspicious activity.</p>

        <p>Submitting: Usually, you can mail, fax, or sometimes even submit these forms online.</p>

          <li><a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/help/scams/identity-theft.html">Help on identity scams</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Happens Next?</h3>

        <p>Once you've reported the identity theft:
          Keep an Eye on Your Credit: Monitor your credit report to catch any further issues quickly.</p>

        <p>Follow Up: Stay on top of any communication from the IRS or state tax agency.
          They might need more info from you.</p>

        <p>Protect Your Future Returns: Consider getting an Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN) from the IRS.
          It’s an extra layer of security for your tax returns.
          Filing these forms is an important step in getting things sorted out and making sure your tax
          identity is secure going forward.

        <h3>S-Corp Filing</h3>

        <p>S corporations are a type of corporation that choose to pass their income, losses, deductions,
          and credits directly to their shareholders for federal tax purposes.</p>

        <p>This means that shareholders report the company’s income and losses on their personal tax returns
          and pay taxes at their individual rates, helping the corporation avoid being taxed twice on the
          same income.</p>

        <p>However, S corporations do pay taxes at the corporate level on certain built-in gains and passive
          income.</p>

        <p>To qualify as an S corporation, a company must meet specific criteria:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>It must be a domestic corporation.</li>
          <li>It can only have eligible shareholders, which include individuals, certain trusts, and estates—not</li>
          <li>partnerships, corporations, or non-resident aliens.</li>
          <li>It can have no more than 100 shareholders.</li>
          <li>It must have only one class of stock.</li>
          <li>It cannot be an ineligible corporation, such as specific financial institutions, insurance companies,</li>
          <li>or domestic international sales corporations.</li>
          <li>In order to become an S corporation, the corporation must submit Form 2553, Election by a Small</li>
          <li>Business Corporation signed by all the shareholders. See the Instructions for Form 2553 PDF for all</li>
          <li>required information and to determine where to file the form.</li>

            </a></li>
        </ul>


        <h3>C-Corp Filing</h3>

        <p>A C Corporation (C-Corp) is a legal structure for a corporation in which the owners, or shareholders,
          are taxed separately from the entity.</p>

        <p>This type of corporation is the most common and offers several benefits, including limited liability
          for its owners, unlimited number of shareholders, and the ability to raise capital more easily.</p>

        <p>However, it also involves a specific way of filing taxes.</p>

        <b>Separate Taxation</b>

        <p>C-Corps are considered separate legal entities from their owners.</p>

        <p>This means the corporation itself files a tax return and pays taxes on its profits.</p>

        <p>This is different from an S-Corp, where income passes through to the shareholders' personal tax returns.</p>

        <p>The corporation files Form 1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return with the IRS each year to report
          its income, gains, losses, deductions, and credits.</p>

        <b>Double Taxation</b>

        <p>One key characteristic of a C-Corp is that it faces double taxation.
          This means the corporation's profits are taxed at the corporate level, and if any profits are distributed
          to shareholders as dividends, those dividends are also taxed at the individual level on the shareholders'
          tax returns.</p>

        <b>Unlimited Shareholders</b>

        <p>
          Unlike S-Corps, C-Corps can have an unlimited number of shareholders, which makes it easier to attract
          investors and raise capital.
          Additionally, shareholders can be individuals, other corporations, or foreign entities.</p>

        <b>Corporate Formalities</b>
        <p>C-Corps must adhere to more formalities than other business structures.
          These include holding regular board meetings, maintaining detailed records, and following specific
          procedures for issuing stock and handling corporate governance.</p>

        <b>Flexibility in Profit Distribution</b>
        <p>C-Corps have more flexibility in distributing profits.
          They can retain earnings within the company for reinvestment or distribute them as dividends to
          shareholders.</p>

        <b>Filing Requirements</b>
        <p>Besides federal taxes, C-Corps may also be required to file state and local taxes depending on where
          they operate.
          C-Corps might also need to pay estimated taxes quarterly.</p>

        <b>Benefits</b>
        <p>Limited liability, easier access to capital, perpetual existence, and potential tax benefits
          if the company reinvests its profits.</p>

        <b>Drawbacks</b>
        <p>Double taxation, more regulatory requirements, and potentially higher administrative costs.
          Overall, filing as a C-Corp is typically chosen by businesses that plan to grow significantly, seek
          outside investors, or want to take advantage of certain corporate tax benefits.</p>

        <b>Filing Requirements</b>
        <p>Form 1120: C-Corporations must file Form 1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return. This form reports
          the corporation’s income, gains, losses, deductions, and credits.</p>
        <p>Due Date: Form 1120 is typically due on the 15th day of the fourth month after the end of the
          corporation’s tax year. For a calendar year corporation, this is April 15th.

        <h3>What is an ITIN ?</h3>

        <p>An Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) is a tax processing number issued by the Internal Revenue
          Service (IRS) for individuals who need to file a U.S. tax return but are not eligible for a Social Security
          Number (SSN).</p>
        <p>ITINs are often used by non-residents and others who are not eligible for an SSN but need to
          comply with U.S. tax laws.</p>

        <h3>How to Get an ITIN: Step by Step</h3>

        <ol>
          <li><b>Determine your eligibility for an ITIN</b>
            <p>Eligible: You need an ITIN if you are required to file a U.S. tax return or are listed on
              a tax return as a dependent or spouse, and you do not qualify for an SSN.</p>
            <p>Not eligible: If you’re eligible for an SSN, you should apply for an SSN instead.</p>
          </li>

          <li><b>Gather Required Documents</b>
            Proof of Identity and Foreign Status:</p>
            <p>You need to provide documents that prove your identity and foreign status.</p>
            <p>This can include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Passport (most commonly used).</li>
              <li>National identification card.</li>
              <li>U.S. driver’s license.</li>
              <li>Birth certificate.</li>
              <li>Foreign voter registration card.</li>
              <li>Documents must be original or certified copies from the issuing agency.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
          </li>

          <li><b>Complete IRS Form W-7</b>
            <p>Form W-7: This is the application form for an ITIN.</p>
            <p>It asks for personal information, including your name,
              address, and foreign tax identification number (if applicable).</p>
            <p>Instructions: Carefully follow the instructions provided with Form W-7.</p>
            <p>You can find the form and instructions on the IRS website at
              https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-7
              .</p>
          </li>

          <li><b>Prepare Your Tax Return</b>
            <p>Attach Form W-7: Generally, you need to attach Form W-7 to your tax return,
              unless you’re applying for an ITIN for reasons other than filing a tax return
              (e.g., applying for a mortgage).</p>
            <p>Tax Return: You should prepare your tax return before submitting your ITIN
              application, as it usually needs to be filed along with Form W-7.</p>
          </li>

          <li><b>Submit Your Application</b>
            <p>Mail: Send your completed Form W-7, the required documents, and your tax return to the IRS address listed
              in the Form W-7 instructions. The address may vary based on whether you are in the U.S. or abroad.</p>
            <p>In-Person: You can also apply in person at IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers or through an IRS-authorized
              Certifying Acceptance Agent (CAA). CAAs can help verify your documents and forward your application to the
              IRS.</p>
          </li>

          <li><b>Wait for Processing</b>
            <p>Processing Time: It typically takes 7 to 11 weeks to receive your ITIN.
              The IRS will mail you a notice with your ITIN once it has been processed.</p>
          </li>

          <li><b>Use Your ITIN</b>
            <p>Tax Filing: Once you receive your ITIN, you use it to file your U.S. tax returns.
              It should be used in place of an SSN on your tax documents.</p>
          </li>

          <li><b>Renew Your ITIN (if necessary)</b>
            <p>Expiration: ITINs can expire if not used on a federal tax return for three consecutive
              years or if not renewed.
              If your ITIN is about to expire, follow IRS instructions to renew it.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
